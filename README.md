# Scientific Calculator (Java CLI)

A powerful and easy-to-use command-line scientific calculator built in Java. This project was created to practice Java fundamentals like user input, mathematical operations, method design, and basic error handling — all in one place.

## 🚀 Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: +, -, *, /
- **Scientific Functions**:
  - Square Root √
  - Power x^y
  - Trigonometry: sin, cos, tan (in degrees)
  - Natural Logarithm (ln)
  - Base-10 Logarithm (log₁₀)
- **Utility Operations**:
  - Absolute Value
  - Rounding:
    - Nearest (Math.round)
    - Ceiling (Math.ceil)
    - Floor (Math.floor)
  - Minimum of Two Numbers
  - Maximum of Two Numbers

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
